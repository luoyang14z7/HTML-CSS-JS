    Coffee culture
</div>

<div class=" con culture-content">
    <p>The world's first coffee tree was found in the horn of Africa.
        Local aboriginal tribes often grind up the fruit of the coffee,
        then mix it with animal fat and make balls of balls.
        The indigenous tribes used these coffee balls as a precious food for the soldiers who were about to go out.
        At that time, people don't understand coffee eaters show irritability is going on, they don't know if it is caused by the irritation of coffee, on the contrary, people like this is coffee eaters of religious fanaticism. The drink was so mysterious that it became a specialty for priests and doctors.

        The cultivation of coffee began in the 15th century.
        For hundreds of years, yemen on the Arabian peninsula was the world's only coffee producer,
        and demand for coffee was strong. In mocha, yemen,
        heavy soldiers are often required to protect coffee when it is shipped. Meanwhile,
        yemen has taken various steps to prevent coffee seedlings from being taken out of the country.
        Despite the restrictions, the Muslim pilgrims who came to the holy city of mecca secretly brought coffee seedlings back to their hometowns, so coffee soon took root in India.
        At that time, Venice, Italy, had numerous merchant ships and merchants from Arabia to trade perfumes, tea and textiles.
        In this way, the coffee spread through Venice to the vast areas of Europe.
        Many European businessmen have become accustomed to drinking coffee.
        Later, on the streets of many European cities, coffee vendors were introduced, and coffee became popular in Europe.</p>
